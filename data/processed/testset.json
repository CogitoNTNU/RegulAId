The hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern\ndifferent aspects than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this Regulation\nwould complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation. For example, machinery or medical\ndevices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety\n()\nrequirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as that sectoral law does not deal with risks\nspecific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts. To\nensure consistency and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden and unnecessary costs, providers of a product\nthat contains one or more high-risk AI system, to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union\nharmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation apply,\nshould have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains\none or more AI systems with all the applicable requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal\nmanner. That flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary\ntesting and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing\ndocumentation and procedures required under existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New\nLegislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation. This should not, in any way, undermine the\nobligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements."
