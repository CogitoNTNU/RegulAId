      "text": "AI systems can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and many parts of society, including\nacross borders, and can easily circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the\nadoption of national rules to ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with\nfundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of the internal market and\nmay decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of\nprotection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences\nhampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related products and\nservices within the internal market should be prevented by laying down uniform obligations for operators and\nguaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the\ninternal market on the basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the\nextent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of\npersonal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of\nlaw enforcement, of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law\nenforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it is\nappropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 TFEU. In light of\nthose specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection\nBoard."

A key characteristic of AI systems is their\ncapability to infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content,\nrecommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and to a capability of AI\nsystems to derive models or algorithms, or both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while\nbuilding an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives,\nand logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the\ntask to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning,\nreasoning or modelling. The term ‘machine-based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference\nto explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or\nto implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system\nin a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the contexts in\nwhich the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system reflect different functions performed by\nAI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with\nvarying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human\ninvolvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could\nexhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems\ncan be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically\nintegrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without being integrated therein\n(non-embedded)."

For example, filters categorising facial or body\nfeatures used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can be used only in relation to\nthe principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the\nproduct on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network\nservices which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be\nconsidered to be ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network\nservices consisting in the sharing of content online."

      "text": "The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined functionally,\nas an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at\na distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference\ndatabase, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such remote\nbiometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in\norder to facilitate significantly the identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes\nAI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the sole purpose of which\nis to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of\na natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to\npremises. That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental\nrights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the\nprocessing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of\n‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all\ninstantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no\nscope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing\nfor minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated\nby a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data\nhas already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves\nmaterial, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which\nhas been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned."

In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which are\nintended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and\noversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination\nand fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding\nrequirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of\ncoherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is\nfounded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are\ndeveloped and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is\nfunctioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety\nmeans that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience\nagainst attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and\nminimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in\naccordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of\nquality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate\ntraceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as\nwell as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their\nrights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that\nincludes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding\ndiscriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental\nwell-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as\nwell as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the\nindividual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the\ndesign and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this\nRegulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are\nencouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best\npractices and standards."

      "text": "The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in exhaustively\nlisted and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the\nimportance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including\nmissing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack; and the\nlocalisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation,\nwhere those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention\norder for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such\na threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensuring\nthat the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification\nsystems. Moreover, the list of criminal offences provided in an annex to this Regulation is based on the 32 criminal\noffences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA (18), taking into account that some of those\noffences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric\nidentification could, foreseeably, be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit\nof the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having\nregard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative\nconsequences. An imminent threat to life or the physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious\ndisruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (4) of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European\nParliament and of the Council (19), where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in\nan imminent threat to life or the physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic\nsupplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State. In addition, this Regulation should\npreserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity\nchecks in the presence of the person concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law\nfor such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to\nuse information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify persons who, during an identity\ncheck, either refuse to be identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, without being required by this\nRegulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling,\nor unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities."

Considering those\ncharacteristics, the AI system provides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk.\nThat condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously\ndrafted documents, for example in relation to professional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to\na certain brand messaging. The third condition should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making\npatterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI\nsystem follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without\nproper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher,\ncan be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential\ninconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is\nonly preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation,\nthus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the\nassessment to follow. That condition covers, inter alia, smart solutions for file handling, which include various\nfunctions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems\nused for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems used in high-risk use-cases listed in an annex to this\nRegulation should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights if the AI\nsystem implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4, point (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 3,\npoint (4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 or Article 3, point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure traceability\nand transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system is not high-risk on the basis of the conditions referred\nto above should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into\nservice and should provide that documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such a provider\nshould be obliged to register the AI system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a view to\nproviding further guidance for the practical implementation of the conditions under which the AI systems listed in\nan annex to this Regulation are, on an exceptional basis, non-high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the\nBoard, provide guidelines specifying that practical implementation, completed by a comprehensive list of practical\nexamples of use cases of AI systems that are high-risk and use cases that are not."

Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI\nmodel should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of\nappropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach.\nHigh-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities\nrecorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better\nunderstood after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to the state of the\nart at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of computation used for the training of\nthe general-purpose AI model measured in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model\ncapabilities. The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used across the\nactivities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as\npre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations\nshould be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological\nand industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be\nsupplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage\nwith the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks\nfor the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and\nassociated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into account the way the model will be placed\non the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the\nCommission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model\nwith systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set\nthreshold. That decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as quality or size of the\ntraining data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its level of autonomy and\nscalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may\ndecide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks."

AI regulatory sandboxes established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other law\nallowing for the establishment of other sandboxes aiming to ensure compliance with law other than this Regulation.\nWhere appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory sandboxes should consider\nthe benefits of using those sandboxes also for the purpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this\nRegulation. Upon agreement between the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI regulatory\nsandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in the framework of the AI regulatory\nsandbox."

However, in such cases, taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it\nshould be ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by this Regulation for\nproviders or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, inter alia, requesting informed consent of\nnatural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement where the\nseeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in\nsuch testing under this Regulation is distinct from, and without prejudice to, consent of data subjects for the\nprocessing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. It is also important to minimise the risks\nand enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world\ntesting plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU\ndatabase subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and\nrequire additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, as well as a written agreement\ndefining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent\npersonnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to\nensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and\ndisregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to\nparticipate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the Union data protection law. As\nregards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of testing\nin real-world conditions should be transferred to third countries only where appropriate and applicable safeguards\nunder Union law are implemented, in particular in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union\nlaw on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with\nUnion law, such as Regulations (EU) 2022/868 (42) and (EU) 2023/2854 (43) of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil."

Member States should utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish\nnew dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, including start-ups, deployers, other innovators and, as\nappropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs throughout their development path by providing guidance\nand responding to queries about the implementation of this Regulation. Where appropriate, these channels should\nwork together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs, including start-ups, and\ndeployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and other relevant stakeholders in\nthe standardisation development processes. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of providers that are SMEs,\nincluding start-ups, should be taken into account when notified bodies set conformity assessment fees. The\nCommission should regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs, including start-ups, through\ntransparent consultations and should work with Member States to lower such costs. For example, translation costs\nrelated to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for\nproviders and other operators, in particular those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one\nof the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication\nwith operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-border deployers. In order\nto address the specific needs of SMEs, including start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for\nthe areas covered by this Regulation, upon request of the Board. Additionally, the Commission should complement\nMember States’ efforts by providing a single information platform with easy-to-use information with regards to this\nRegulation for all providers and deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness\nabout the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the convergence of best\npractices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems. Medium-sized enterprises which until recently\nqualified as small enterprises within the meaning of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (44)\nshould have access to those support measures, as those new medium-sized enterprises may sometimes lack the legal\nresources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding of, and compliance with, this Regulation."

While the full effect of those prohibitions follows with the establishment of the\ngovernance and enforcement of this Regulation, anticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take\naccount of unacceptable risks and to have an effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the\ninfrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational before\n2 August 2026, therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure should apply from 2 August\n2025. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations\nfor providers of general-purpose AI models should apply from 2 August 2025. Codes of practice should be ready by\n2 May 2025 in view of enabling providers to demonstrate compliance on time. The AI Office should ensure that\nclassification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological developments. In addition, Member States\nshould lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that\nthey are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore the provisions\non penalties should apply from 2 August 2025."
